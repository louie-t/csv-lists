# csv-lists

This is a basic console program that currently allows users to manage lists. The data is stored in csv files so the lists are saved when the program is closed. When a list is created, the user will have the option to set the categories of the list. When a future item is added to that specific list, they will be prompted to input something for each of the categories.
